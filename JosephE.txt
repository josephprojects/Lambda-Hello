Hello, my name is Joseph Eastman..

Three words that describe me: creative, open-minded, easy-going

I enjoy mmo's, reading, singing and baseball in my free time! :)

I enjoy mmo's for the social and community aspect outside of my local group of friends for the diversity you can find in people.
I like reading for the ability it has to calm me and get me to relax and focus on something interesting.
I enjoy singing because I am able to have fun coming up with new songs to perform with a cool group of people.
I like baseball for the team aspect and the fun yet somewhat competitive nature of the game.
